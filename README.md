# What is BuildDoc?
> BuildDoc is a script to automate tasks, very similar to [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/). It was designed with simplicity in mind. It also looks good on my resume.

# Known Issues:
> - Comparing 2 strings will fail if the first string has a space. If the second string has a space, the space will be ignored, and the string will be smushed together
